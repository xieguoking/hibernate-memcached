## Adding hibernate-memcached to your application ##
If you are using Maven2 for your application build you can follow the instructions on the  MavenRepository page. For those that aren't using Maven2 you'll need to collect a few simple jars for yourself. I am going to assume you already have hibenrnate3 setup before you came here.

You'll need...
  * hibernate-memcached-(version).jar
  * [memcached-2.3.1.jar](http://spymemcached.googlecode.com/files/memcached-2.3.1.jar)
  * [slf4j-1.5.0.jar](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/slf4j/slf4j-api/1.5.0/slf4j-api-1.5.0.jar)
  * An slf4j implementation for your preferred logging framework. For log4j you can use [slf4j-log4j12-1.5.0.jar](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/slf4j/slf4j-log4j12/1.5.0/slf4j-log4j12-1.5.0.jar).

## Configuring Hibernate ##
The first thing to do is to tell hibernate which cache provider you'd like to use, and to enable the second level cache.
|hibernate.cache.provider\_class|com.googlecode.hibernate.memcached.MemcachedCacheProvider|
|:------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|

Using just the property above you get basic entity caching by default. The hibernate-memcached library supports query caching, but you have to enable query caching separately.
|hibernate.cache.use\_query\_cache|true|
|:--------------------------------|:---|

!Now you can start setting up the hibernate-memcached specific properties. The hibernate-memcached properties are divided into two categories; cache-wide settings and cache-region settings.

### Cache Wide Settings ###
The cache wide settings all have defaults can mostly be overwritten at a cache-region level.
| **Property** | **Default** | **Description** |
|:-------------|:------------|:----------------|
| hibernate.memcached.servers | localhost:11211 | Space delimited list of memcached instances in host:port format |
| hibernate.memcached.cacheTimeSeconds | 300 | The default number of seconds items should be cached. Can be overriden at the region level. |
| hibernate.memcached.keyStrategy | HashCodeKeyStrategy | Sets the strategy class to to use for generating cache keys. Must provide a class name that implements KeyStrategy |
| hibernate.memcached.readBufferSize | DefaultConnectionFactory.DEFAULT\_READ\_BUFFER\_SIZE | The read buffer size for each server connection from this factory |
| hibernate.memcached.operationQueueLength | DefaultConnectionFactory.DEFAULT\_OP\_QUEUE\_LEN | Maximum length of the operation queue returned by this connection factory |
| hibernate.memcached.operationTimeout | DefaultConnectionFactory.DEFAULT\_OPERATION\_TIMEOUT | Default operation timeout in milliseconds |
| hibernate.memcached.hashAlgorithm | HashAlgorithm.NATIVE\_HASH | Which hash algorithm to use when adding items to the cache. Prior to hibernate-memcached 1.2 this defaulted to HashAlgorithm.KETAMA\_HASH |
| hibernate.memcached.connectionFactory (since 1.2) | DefaultConnectionFactory | The "simple" name of the ConnectionFactory class to use from spymemcached. Must be one of DefaultConnectionFactory, KetamaConnectionFactory, or BinaryConnectionFactory |
| hibernate.memcached.clearSupported | false | Enables support for the MemcachedCache.clear() method for all cache regions. The way clear is implemented for memcached is expensive and adds overhead to all get/set operations. It is not recommended for production use. |

### Cache Region Settings ###
Cache region properties are set by giving your cached data a "region name" in hibernate. You can tune the MemcachedCache instance for your region using the following properties. These properties essentially override the cache-wide properties above.
**Note:** that the square brackets are there to denote the text you need to replace, they are not part of the property name.

| **Property** | **Default** | **Description** |
|:-------------|:------------|:----------------|
| hibernate.memcached.YOUR\_REGION\_NAME.cacheTimeSeconds | none, see hibernate.memcached.cacheTimeSeconds | Set the cache time for this cache region, overriding the cache-wide setting. |
| hibernate.memcached.YOUR\_REGION\_NAME.keyStrategy | none, see hibernate.memcached.keyStrategy | Overrides the strategy class to to use for generating cache keys in this cache region. Must provide a class name that implements KeyStrategy |
| hibernate.memcached.YOUR\_REGION\_NAME.clearSupported | none, see hibernate.memcached.clearSupported | Enables clear() operations for this cache region only. Again, the clear operation incurs cost on every get/set operation. |
