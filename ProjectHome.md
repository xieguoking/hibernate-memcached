A library for using [Memcached](http://www.danga.com/memcached/) as a second level distributed cache in Hibernate.

  * Based on the excellent [spymemcached client](http://code.google.com/p/spymemcached/)
  * Includes support for the Whalin (danga) memcached client
  * Supports entity and query caching.
  * See the [Configuration](Configuration.md) page
  * See how easy it is to [configure in Grails](ConfiguringGrails.md)

If you have any questions, or just want to drop a line to say it's working great :) use the [google-group](http://groups.google.com/group/hibernate-memcached).

I've moved everything to github, go [there](https://github.com/raykrueger/hibernate-memcached) instead.
